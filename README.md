## Homework 1 : 
### 1. Deep Neural Network for Classification
In this exercise, please implement a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model by yourself to recognize Tibetan handwriting numerals. The following table shows the corresponding Arabic numerals with respect to Tibetan numerals. The samples of this dataset can be found in the following figure. The details of this dataset can be referred to:https://github.com/bat67/TibetanMNIST. Please use train.npz as training data and test.npz as test data. (Download page)
### 2. Convolutional Neural Network for Image Recognition
In this exercise, you will construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition by using Medical Masks Dataset. The original dataset comes from Eden Social Welfare Foundation which contains the pictures of people wearing medical masks along with the labels containing their descriptions. There are 682 images with over 3000 faces wearing masks and around 700 masks worn either wrongly or not worn at all.

## Homework 2 : 
### 1. Recurrent Neural Network for Classification
In this problem, you are given a csv file that contains the number of confirmed people with COVID-19 in a period of time in different countries. You are required to implement a recurrent neural network to classify if the number of confirmed people will increase in the next day.
### 2. Variational Autoencoder for Image Generation
In this exercise, you will construct a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image reconstruction by the animation faces dataset
